Tagging functionality
Great video. Any idea how do I extend the functionality of this comment section with ability of tagging users in comment with '@' just like instagram allows dynamically?
It's more advanced stuff. You need a handler when @ symbol is typed
in input and return a list of users from the backend to autocomplete.
Also every time when the commend is created you need to past mentioned
user on backend and send him a notification.

Thoughts: 
    
    - would I want to do text Verification? 
        - pros
            - higher quality data, fewer bots / scammers
            - account recovery (not a problem if use federated id)
        - cons
            - phone numbers constantly change
            - pay for solution
    
    - Should I use next-auth ? 
        - pros
            - most people use facebook
            - can add un/pw later?  
        - cons

    - City / Country Autocomplete solution would be nice ? 
        - GeoDB Cities 1,000 / day free tier
        - GeoDB Should probably be sufficient.
        - Support French?   
        - alternatively List of countries dropdown?
        pros
